- âš¡ Fun fact: Trying to start a revolution building a startup if you want to join the revolution message me directly. Those who live in Eastern Standard Time zone will be considered first. However I will also be making exceptions based on your skill set. Meaning the more senior you are the further away you can be from homebase. We were taught to fish it is time to start.
